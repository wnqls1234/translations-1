                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When your Project has been mastered, the next step is to publish it. The Project page offers many options, categorized into three main operations, including burning an audio CD, making a disc image file, and making audio files. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><a name="kanchor162"></a>Burn an Audio CD </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">You can burn your mastered Project to a standard Red Book audio CD directly from the Project page. Red Book is the most widely adopted technical standard for audio CDs, and it includes specifications for minimum and maximum track durations, maximum number of tracks, and how audio is encoded to the CD. Because the Project page adheres to this standard, you can be sure your audio CDs are compatible with almost any CD player. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To burn your Project to an audio CD, click on the [Burn] button at the top of the Project page. In the Burn Audio CD dialog, you can select the device you wish to use to burn the CD, as well as the speed of the burning process. In general, using slower speeds in the burning process reduces the chance for errors. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Burn Options </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Several options in the Burn Audio CD dialog are intended to prevent common CD-burning errors: Test Write, Use Burnproof, and Use Temporary Imagefile. These options usually increase the time it takes to burn a CD in the Project page but they help to prevent wasting time and blank CDs on failed attempts. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Test Write option  runs tests before attempting to burn the CD in order to be sure the necessary computer resources are available. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Burnproof is a technology capable of preventing buffer under-run errors with some CD burners, in which the CD-writing process is interrupted, and the CD writer is forced to stop burning the CD before it is finished. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Use Temporary Imagefile option  changes the burn process so that an image of the CD to be burned is created before attempting to burn the CD. This helps to eliminate potential problems related to data not being made available fast enough while writing to the CD. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><a name="kanchor163"></a>Make a Disc Image </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Publishing your Project might require a disc-image file. For instance, sending your Project to a professional CD duplicator might require digital transmission of the content of your CD, rather than sending a potentially imperfect physical copy. Also, you may wish to use a different application to burn your CDs, in which case you need an image file. There are many file formats for disc images, some better suited to audio CD creation than others. <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> uses a continuous audio Wave file and a cue file to achieve the most universal support. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To create an image of your Project, click on the [Image] button at the top of the Project page. Options are available for file format, resolution, and sample rate, as well as the ability to toggle Realtime Processing and simultaneously upload the Project to a linked SoundCloud account. In making an image, <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> creates a cue file and a single, continuous audio file of your entire Project and places them in your Project folder. The cue file contains all of the necessary information to create the separate audio tracks for your CD by referencing the continuous Wave file. Many third-party CD-burning applications can create a CD using the Wave and cue files together. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><a name="DDP"></a><a name="kanchor164"></a>DDP Export</h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">DDP images are quickly becoming the standard method of getting a disc image from mastering to disc manufacturing. The DDP image contains all the contents of your master disc, plus formatting information that ensures your replicas  exactly match your master. To create a DDP image of your Project, click on the [DDP] button at the top of the Project page.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">All of the DDP image data is exported to a single folder with the name of the Project appended with "DDP." This folder can be delivered to a duplicator. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><a name="kanchor165"></a>Digital Release </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is possible to publish your Project to a single folder containing all Tracks in your Project, properly tagged with the appropriate meta-information. A common use for this would be to quickly create an MP3 album in one folder and then upload it to a Web site or online retailer for distribution. This process is similar to creating a mix on the Song page, as described in the <a href="../Mixing_Topics/Mixing_Down.htm#9.9.1">Create a Mixdown</a> section. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Click on the [Digital Release] button at the top of the Project page to open the Digital Release dialog. In this dialog, you can choose whether you want to create WAV, AIFF, FLAC, CAF, Ogg Vorbis, or MP3 files (or, at 384 kHz sample rate, just WAV, AIFF, or FLAC), and where you wish to store the files. You can also choose a sample rate, a resolution (bit rate), and select Constant or Variable bit rate, depending on the format. You also have the option to simultaneously upload your Project to a linked SoundCloud account.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The folder to which all new files are written is named according to the Artist and Disc fields in the Project meta-information, at the top of the Track Column. If the Artist field is disabled, the new folder takes its title from the Disc name field. If the Artist field is enabled, the new folder title  shows the artist name followed by the disc title.  If neither the Artist or Disc fields have been filled in, the folder gets its title from the name of the Project. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The name of each Track in the Track column is used for the name of the new files created. In the Options section of this window, you can include Track numbers and the artist name in the name of each new file to be created in the album. All other meta-information supplied for each Track is used to tag the new files appropriately. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">You can also choose Realtime Processing, to mix the Project down in real time. </p>
