With a DAW such as <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>, this simply means saving your mix to a stereo file.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The top section of the Export Mixdown menu is where you can select a location and name for the mix file. Click on the [...] button to choose a file location. Click on the file name, type in a new name, and press [Enter] to choose a name for the file. Location defaults to the Mixdown folder in folder for your Song, but once you set a new mixdown location, <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> uses that location for further mixdowns, until the next time you close the Song. Mixdowns are titled "Mixdown" by default, but once you set a name, that name is used by default for any further mixdowns of the current Song.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Publishing menu lets you choose to send your mixdown to <span class="GeneralCompanyNameShort">PreSonus</span> Notion software (choose "Send to Notion") or upload it to a connected SoundCloud account (choose "Upload to Soundcloud"), once the mixdown is completed. For more information on working with Notion in combination with <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>, see <a href="../Fundamentals_Topics/Working with PreSonus Notion Software.htm">this section</a>. For more information on working with SoundCloud, see <a href="#SoundCl">SoundCloud Support</a>.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Select the format for your mix file in the middle section of the Export Mixdown menu. Choose from the Wave, AIFF, FLAC, CAF, Ogg Vorbis, M4A, AAC/ALAC, or MP3 file formats, and then choose the desired resolution and sample rate. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The MP3 format also offers an option to export at a Constant or Variable bit rate. The encoder will vary the bit rate during export, allocating more bits to complex passages and fewer bits to simple ones. This flexibility allows generating higher quality output files compared to the Constant bit rate mode at the same overall bit rate.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If you want to put your mix on a standard audio CD, create a 16-bit, 44.1 kHz Wave file.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Choose the Between Loop  option to only export the range of your Song between the Left and Right Locators. Choose Between Song Start/End Marker to  export the range of your Song between the Song Start and End Markers, as seen in the Marker Track.  Choosing Between Each Marker  exports separate audio files for the range between each marker in the Song for each Track, placing them in folders named after the markers. Choosing Between Selected Markers lets you choose a pair of Markers to export the range between. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The duration of the range to be exported is displayed in the Duration field. Note that when Between Each Marker is selected, the Duration field  still shows the full length of the Song, signifying the total length of audio to be exported, rather than the length of any one section as dictated by the Markers.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Choose an output from which the mix is to be created in the Output selection box. Only the Main Out  appears in the list, by default. If there are any Sub Outs in the Console, they appear in this list as well. Check Import to Track if you would like the mix imported to a new Track in your Song.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Check Mono to generate a monaural mix. This is useful to check for phase cancellation issues between the left and right channels of a stereo mix when the user is listening through a single speaker. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Check Bypass Master Effects to bypass the Insert effects on the Main Output Channel of the Console when rendering the mixdown. This is useful if you have inserted effects to simulate the mastering stage, such as a compressor and limiter, but would like to render the mixdown without them in order to address this in a mastering Project, or to preserve flexibility for another mastering engineer.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Check Realtime Processing if you wish to export your mix in real time. This option should be used if your Song requires External Instruments or external hardware processing so that musical data and audio  flows to and through these external sources during mixdown.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Check Close After Export if you would like to close the Export Mixdown menu after exporting your mix.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Check Overlap and specify a duration if you would like to add an overlap to the exported range so you can create crossfades between them later on.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Certain file formats, such as MP3, can contain additional information about the audio which is referred to as "meta-information". In the <span class="Italic">Song/Song Setup/Meta Information</span> menu are many fields of data that can be filled in for each Song. These fields are used to tag audio files, so that they are labeled correctly for playback in software and various media players. All audio files exported from a Song that can contain meta-information are tagged with the meta-information supplied here. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">At the bottom of the Meta Information menu, you can choose to display the Song’s meta-information when the Song is opened. The information can also be viewed at any time by selecting Song Information from the Song menu. The Song Information window also contains a Notes tab, in which you can type in any text information about the Song that may be useful later.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The meta-information displayed represents what listeners  see in their media players when playing the Song. Displaying this info could also be helpful in remembering aspects of the Song production later. </p>

You can also download sounds from SoundCloud (when available) directly into <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To upload a new mixdown to a connected SoundCloud account as soon as it is created, choose "Upload to SoundCloud"&#160;from the Publishing menu in the Export Mixdown window. The SoundCloud Client opens when the new mixdown is complete. In this dialog, you are able to upload audio straight to SoundCloud, and set various SoundCloud-specific options as you do so.  You can also access the SoundCloud Client directly by navigating to <span class="Italic"><span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>/SoundCloud Client</span>.</p>

You would browse to that person's SoundCloud folder, listed under the SoundCloud heading in Cloud, and drag the desired audio into the arrangement. A special Event is placed in the arrangement, and the Transfers menu  opens to indicate the download’s progress. When the download is complete, the waveform  appears for the Event, and you can proceed as you normally would with any audio material. </p>
