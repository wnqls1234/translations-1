                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Before Mixing </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The production work done before mixing has a great impact on the mixing process. Here are a few guidelines you may find helpful: </p>
                                                <ul class="ul_1" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">
                                                    <li class="ListParagraph_1" value="1">Finish the arrangement of your Song before attempting to mix. The addition, deletion, and rearrangement of parts can change the relationships between all of the parts in your Song, which  affects the mix. </li>
                                                    <li class="ListParagraph_1" value="2">If any part of your Song is problematic, it is unlikely to work well in a mix. The “fix it in the mix” approach usually leads to a lot of wasted time, only to achieve poor results. Be sure you are pleased with the individual parts of your Song before attempting to mix. </li>
                                                    <li class="ListParagraph_1" value="3">Some parts of your Song might rely on a certain amount of mixing and effects processing to achieve the desired sound and character in the arrangement. It is very easy to let this type of “mixing” carry over into mixing the entire Song. If you find yourself working on many Tracks at once, you are probably mixing the Song, rather than a particular part. </li>
                                                    <li class="ListParagraph_1" value="4">If your Song lacks personality, vibe, or feeling before you start mixing, it is unlikely to gain any of these subjective qualities during mixdown. In this case, take the time to re-record certain parts, rearrange the Song, or even start over from scratch. </li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Mixing Workflow </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">While mixing requires an objective knowledge of many tools, the process is an art form. If you were to ask ten mix engineers to mix the same Song, each mix would sound different. There are no step-by-step or “mix by numbers” instructions you can follow to achieve good results. The following broad concepts may help guide you in the mixing process. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Balance </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Mixing is largely about balance. The various elements in a mix are balanced with each other so that each element can be clearly heard and contributes as desired to the overall mix. This entails using the faders to vary levels and equalizing sounds so that there is no “competition” between elements with similar frequency content. There is a limited amount of space in the mix, based on individual energy levels for each frequency in the audible spectrum and the relationships of the sounds within the stereo field.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">A popular view on mixing maintains that auditory perception occurs within a three-dimensional space, wherein the principles of mixing are highly visual. A number of variables determine how we perceive location, including frequency, phase, reflections, and relative amplitude (level). </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Therefore, while mixing, various elements can be positioned in the 3-D listening space using faders, equalizers, ambient effects, and panning to achieve appropriate balance across the entire mix. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Busing </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Busing can make mixing much easier by creating submixes of certain elements. For instance, a live drum set may be recorded across eight or more individual Channels. In this case, the drums can first be submixed to their own bus or stereo channel, and then the submix can be blended into the overall mix. To accomplish this in <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>, refer to both the <a href="Effects_Signal_Routing.htm#_9.2.22_Busing">Busing</a> and <a href="Groups.htm">Groups</a> sections of this chapter. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Busing is also used to build on individual Tracks to create a “larger” sound. For instance, a vocal Track might be bused to an FX Channel with a chorus effect inserted, as well as to a bus where all of the vocals are mixed and sent to a reverb. These various elements are all mixed using individual faders and add to the overall vocal sound in the mix. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Busing can be used creatively to achieve an endless variety of results. Experiment with this concept to help achieve a unique sound. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Preparing Your Mix for Mastering </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Too often, mixes are sent to the mastering phase of production after they have been compressed, equalized, limited, and generally processed to the loudest possible levels. This is usually the result of people comparing their unmastered mixes to finished, mastered, published songs. Indeed, it’s tempting to make your mixes as loud as possible while mixing. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">However, mixing is mostly about achieving excellent balance. It is not about making the mix loud, especially when compared to mastered mixes. During mastering, you can bring the overall loudness up without affecting the balance achieved during mixing. But if your mixes are already as loud as they possibly can be, little can be done during mastering to make the most of the balance you achieved in the mix, nor can you easily balance one mix with another to create a cohesive album. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Therefore, when listening to reference material (which we highly recommend), try to ignore the overall loudness and just pay attention to how the individual elements are balanced. Avoid placing compressors or limiters on the master channel of your mix. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Maximizing Computer Processing Power </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If you are only listening to playback of previously recorded audio, and not to live inputs being recorded, input and output latency (the time it takes to get audio into and back out of your computer) is irrelevant. Besides, <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>’s automatic delay compensation  keeps all playback Tracks in sync with each other, regardless of plug-in processing. Therefore, during mixdown, the Block Size can be increased to allow more time for processing to occur before the audio is heard, which  enables you to use more plug-ins and other processing.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To adjust the Block Size, navigate to the <span class="Italic"><span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>/Options/Audio Setup</span> menu (Mac OS X: <span class="Italic">Preferences/Audio Setup</span>). In Windows, if your audio interface allows it, as most ASIO devices do, adjust the Hardware Block Size by clicking and dragging the horizontal fader. The value of the Hardware Block Size is reported next to the horizontal fader. In Mac OS X, there is a pop-up menu to adjust Block Size. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">In the Windows version of <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>, the Internal Block Size is locked by default to the same value as the Hardware Block Size. Click on the Lock selection box to unlock the Internal Block Size. Then click on the Internal Block Size value to choose from the list of available values. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">In Mac OS X, there is no difference between Internal and Hardware Block Size. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Rendering and Deactivating Virtual Instruments </h3>

Therefore, it is sometimes worthwhile to render the audio output of an Instrument Track to an Audio Track and then deactivate the virtual instrument.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The most flexible option you have is to use Track Transform to render Audio and Instrument Tracks and temporarily remove the related virtual instruments or effects, as described in the <a href="../Editing_Topics/Chapter-Editing.htm">Editing</a> chapter. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Alternatively, you can do the following to accomplish this: </p>
