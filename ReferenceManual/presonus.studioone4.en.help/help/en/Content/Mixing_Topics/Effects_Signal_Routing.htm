                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Inserts are used to apply an effect directly to a single Channel or Bus. Insert effects are literally inserted into the audio signal chain within the Channel or Bus. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Insert Device Rack contains all Insert effects on a given Channel and is visible in the Console. To add an Insert effect to any Channel, drag-and-drop an effect from the Browser into the Insert Device Rack of a Channel in the Console or click-and-drag directly to a Track or Track Lane in the Arrange view. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When navigating audio effects in the Browser, some effects have a navigation arrow next to them. Click on this arrow to expose the presets for the effect. Click-and-drag a preset into the Insert Device Rack on any Channel to add the effect with the preset already loaded. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Alternatively, you can click on the Add Insert button at the top of the Insert Device Rack to add an Insert effect to a Channel from a pop-up menu. The plug-in menu functions like a smaller version of <a href="../The_Browser_Topics/Chapter-The_Browser.htm" class="MCXref xref">The Browser</a>, giving you sorting options, and access to the <a href="../The_Browser_Topics/Instruments_and_Effects_Tabs.htm#Favorite" class="MCXref xref">Favorite and Recent Plug-ins</a> lists. You can navigate this list using the [Arrow] keys on your keyboard. Click in the search bar and type to find plug-ins by name.</p>
                                                <p>Alternatively you can choose to browse plug-ins from a basic menu. To change the plug-in menu style, go to the <a href="../Setup_Topics/Advanced_Options.htm#Console" class="MCXref xref">Console</a> Advanced Options and select the Plug-in Menu style from the popup menu.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To edit an Insert, double-click on it in the Insert Device Rack, or click on the menu arrow (or [Right]/[Ctrl]-click anywhere on the Insert)&#160;and select Edit from the pop-up menu. This opens the user interface for the Insert effect, where you can edit the effect’s parameters. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When audio effects are inserted on the same Channel, all of the plug-ins  appear in tabs at the top of the plug-in header GUI. This makes switching between effects in the same Insert Device Rack and signal path quick and easy. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The user interfaces for effects from third-party manufacturers  vary drastically; for more information, please refer to the documentation for each effect. <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>’s built-in effects are discussed in depth in the <a href="../Built-In_Effects_Topics/Chapter-Built_In_Effects.htm">Built-In Effects</a> chapter. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Inserts affect the audio signal path in the top-to-bottom sequential order in which they are inserted. An Insert can be reordered by clicking-and-dragging it above, below, or in between other Inserts. It is helpful to experiment with different signal paths to achieve the best possible sound or a particular effect. </p>
                                                <h4 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Navigating Inserts </h4>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">By default, only one window displays the user interface for an open Insert effect. This keeps screen clutter and window juggling to a minimum. To quickly switch between Insert effects on a single Channel, click on the chosen effect tab at the top of the plug-in header GUI. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Alternatively, press [F11] on the keyboard to open the effect editor for the selected Audio Track, then press [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[Page Up]/[Page Down] to cycle through the effects in that Channel’s Device Rack. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Inserts can be also re-ordered by dragging them from one position to another in the list of Inserts at the top of the plug-in GUI.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online"> The interface for any Insert can be made to stay open in an independent window until you choose to close it by clicking on the Pin button in the upper right of the Insert Effect window. With an Insert effect pinned, opening another Insert effect  opens a new Insert Effect window. Any number of Insert Effect windows can be pinned and open simultaneously. </p>
                                                <h4 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Copying Inserts to Other Channels</h4>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is often helpful to be able to copy an Insert effect, including its current settings, to another Channel. To do this, click on the desired Insert effect in the Insert Device Rack and drag it directly onto any other Channel or into the Insert Device Rack on any other Channel. Dragging an Insert effect to the left or right edge of the viewable Console  scrolls the Console left or right to expose any Channels beyond those currently viewable. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is also possible to click on the Copy button in the plug-in header GUI, then switch to another instance of the same plug-in and click on Paste to copy settings from one instance to another. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">You can drag an Insert effect to any Sends Device Rack to create a new FX Channel with that effect inserted (its settings intact), and route that Send to the new FX&#160;Channel.</p>
                                                <h5 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Moving Inserts to Other Channels</h5>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">In the event that you want to move, rather than copy, an Insert to another Channel, hold [Alt] as you drag the Insert from one Channel to the other.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Mix Engine FX is a plug-in format for <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>, specializing in processing tasks that affect multiple channels in a song (such as console emulation). In the case of console emulation, most systems require you to insert a special "channel" plug-in on each channel in the song, and a "bus" plug-in across any busses. This increases the time it takes to set up a new song, and makes managing the process complex, as any changes desired for the whole mix often must be carried out across multiple channel and bus plug-ins.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Mix Engine FX centralizes this and other similar processes. You simply drop a compatible plug-in onto the Mix Engine FX slot on the Master Bus, or any other bus you wish to affect. All Channels that feed that Bus are affected by the Mix Engine FX plug-in at their source (taking the place of the "channel" plug-in), and all parameters are controlled from the one central plug-in interface (which takes the place of the "bus" plug-in). </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Unlike most solutions that rely on multiple plug-ins working together, Mix Engine FX can be bypassed with just a click, allowing for easy A/B testing between dry and processed signals across the whole mix. Another advantage to this method is inter-channel processing. Because Mix Engine FX are "aware" of all channels flowing into them, effects like inter-channel console-style crosstalk are made possible.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Each Bus can have one Mix Engine FX plug-in inserted at a time.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Certain effects can accept an input from an audio source that dynamically changes the behavior of the effect. This is called “sidechaining,” and it facilitates processes such as keying, ducking, and de-essing. Sidechaining is accomplished by using a Send to route audio to a special Sidechain input on an Insert effect.</p>
                                                <p>It is possible to send to the Sidechain input of any insert effect, whether or not the sidechain is engaged in the effect. Alternatively, the sidechain connection can be assigned inside the target insert effect. Click on the arrow button next to the Sidechain activation button, then select one or more channels from the popup menu. For the sidechain to work in the effect, it must be engaged in the effect.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">An example of sidechaining is when a gate is triggered by a specific audio signal. In this case, the gate  opens and closes dynamically in response to the audio signal coming in the sidechain, rather than responding to the program signal on the Channel where the gate is inserted. Several of <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>’s built-in effects support sidechaining, including the Compressor and Gate.

This is done in the same manner that a Send is used to route audio to an FX Channel, except that the Bus Channel is selected. This can be used, among other things, for “multing”—routing a Channel to multiple places—which is a convenient way to layer sounds. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Buses can be extremely useful when mixing. You can route Channels directly to buses to help organize a mix into common elements, such as routing all Drum Tracks directly to a drum bus. Sends are often used to route a channel to multiple buses in order to layer a signal into various elements of a mix. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To create a new Bus, [Right]/[Ctrl]-click in blank space in the Console, or on any channel, and select Add Bus. You can also select any number of Channels, then [Right]/[Ctrl]-click on one of the selected Channels and choose Add Bus for Selected Channels to quickly create a new Bus and route the selected Channels to that new Bus.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Once you have a Bus with Tracks assigned to it, you can [Right]/[Ctrl]-click the Bus and choose Hide Sources to hide all Tracks assigned to that Bus in the Console. [Right]/[Ctrl]-click the Bus again and choose Show Sources to make source Tracks visible again.</p>

The Bus sends its summed signal to the Main Out by default but can also be routed to Sub Out Channels. Buses have Sends that can be used the same way as other Sends in <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is possible to nest buses infinitely (A to B, B to C, C to D, and so on). Feedback prevention is in place so that you can’t create a bus routing that would cause a feedback loop (e.g., A to B, B to C, C to A).</p>

When any Channel in the Console is soloed, all Channels with Solo Save engaged are also soloed, and all other Channels are muted. To engage Solo Save on any Channel, [Shift]-click on its Solo button in Console. The Solo button is green when Solo Save is engaged. </p>
