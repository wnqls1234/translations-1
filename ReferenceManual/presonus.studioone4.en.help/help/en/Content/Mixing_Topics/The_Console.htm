Audio Tracks in the Arrange view are directly represented by Audio Channels in the Console, whereas Instrument Tracks have no direct representation in the Console. Instead, Instrument Channels represent the audio output of virtual instruments. There are several other Channel types discussed below, including Input, Output, Bus, and FX Channels. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Audio Channels show the hardware audio input selection. Instrument Channels display the name of the virtual instrument from which they get their input. Bus and FX Channels display a graphical count of the number of Tracks assigned or sent to them, rather than a discrete display of input channels, as their input source is usually from multiple Channels. Click on the Input area on a Bus or FX Channel to display a pop-up list of all assigned/sent Tracks. Clicking on a Track in this list selects and expands that Track in the Mix view.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Click on any Input or Output to display and choose from a list of available routing options for any Channel. If several Channels are selected they can be assigned instantly to the same Input or Output by making a selection for any one of the selected Channels. It is also possible to assign all selected Inputs or Outputs in ascending order based on the audio hardware configuration.</p>

The panner can be clicked-and-dragged horizontally, allowing the audio for each Channel to be positioned left or right in the stereo field. The volume fader can be click-and-dragged vertically to control the output volume for each Channel. Numerical values may also be entered for pan and volume. </p>

You can also press [M] for Mute or [S] for Solo on the keyboard to mute or solo selected Channels. Muting  silences the Channel’s audio from the Console so you won’t hear it. Soloing silences all except the audio for the soloed Channel, so you  only hear the soloed Channel. Any number of Channels can be muted or soloed at one time. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When using the [M] or [S] keys to mute or solo an Instrument Track that has a virtual instrument attached to it, mute or solo is applied to the note data Track in the Arrangement view, rather than to the audio Track in the Mix view. [M] and [S] have no effect on Bus or FX Channels.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">You can perform a Global Solo Off, which disengages Solo on any Track that has it engaged, by pressing and holding [Ctrl] on the keyboard and then clicking on any Solo button. Performing the [Ctrl]-click again  recalls the previous solo settings, returning any previously soloed channels to the solo state. This can be useful when comparing a group of soloed Tracks to other Tracks in your mix. </p>

Audio, Instrument, and Bus Channels  include Insert and Send Device Racks; FX Channels  only have an Insert Device Rack. Send Device Racks can be hidden or displayed:  Open the Console options (the wrench-shaped button) and change the setting of the Sends/Cue mix option inside Channel Components. Note that the Insert Device Racks are hidden in Small Console mode.</p>

An Instrument Track outputs to a virtual instrument, and the virtual instrument then creates sound. Thus, virtual instruments output audio to Instrument Channels in the Console. A virtual instrument might have any number of outputs, as described in the <a href="../Recording_Topics/Instrument_Tracks.htm#_5.2.5_Set_Up">Set Up Multiple Virtual Instrument Outputs</a> section of the <a href="../Recording_Topics/Chapter-Recording.htm">Recording</a> chapter, and each  has a corresponding Channel in the Console. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The audio output of multiple Channels can be routed directly to a single Bus Channel, which is always a stereo Channel. This lets you create a submix so that the audio from several Channels can be processed together before being routed to the main output. Although less common, it is also possible to use Sends to route audio to Bus Channels. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">For instance, several drum Tracks might be routed to a Drum Bus, where the audio is compressed and equalized, and then routed to the main output. That audio could also be routed to an FX Channel, through a Send, to apply a reverb effect, which would be applied to all audio routed to that FX Channel. </p>
                                                <h4 class="Heading4" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">FX </h4>

Audio can be routed from any Channel through a Send to an FX Channel, which can have any number of effects inserted in its Insert Device Rack. For instance, several keyboard Tracks and a guitar Track could be routed via Sends to an FX Channel with a reverb plug-in inserted, so that all of the instruments sound like they are in the same physical space. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Dragging an audio effect or FX Chain to the Send slot of a Channel in the Console creates a new FX Channel with the same name as the effect or FX Chain, and routes audio from the original Channel to the new FX Channel,  via a Send.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Output Channels are routed directly to hardware audio outputs and can be stereo or mono, depending on the configured outputs to which they connect. Every Song  has at least one stereo Output Channel, which is named Main Out by default. The Main Out is, by default, where the entire Console mix of all other Channels is routed. You  generally listen to this output when monitoring your mix, as this is the output from which exported mixdowns are derived. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Main Out Channel is always locked to the far right end of the Console and cannot be moved. This output features a stereo <a href="Metering.htm#_9.4.2_Peak/RMS_Meters">Peak/RMS Meter</a>, as well as <a href="Metering.htm#_9.4.4_K-System_Metering">K-System Metering</a>. Other configured hardware outputs are represented in the Console by a type of Output Channel called a Sub Out. Sub Outs appear to the right of the mixer when the Outputs panel is open. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Main Out and Sub Out Channels feature Metronome controls, allowing independent metronome on/off and level control for each hardware output. Note that every stereo Output Channel also features a Mono switch to allow for quick summed-mono monitoring, which is commonly used to check a mix for mono compatibility. </p>
