These are the primary controls you'll use to sculpt your sound. You can enable or disable each of these modules by clicking the module's name. To the right of these controls are the Global parameters, which let you tune the overall behavior and capabilities of the synth to your needs.</p>

Each Osc has its own set of parameters, which differ in small but significant ways. In both Osc 1 and Osc 2, you'll see the following controls:</p>
                                                <ul data-mc-conditions="General.Online">
                                                    <li value="1"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Bypass </span>Click the [Osc 1] or [Osc 2] button to disable or enable each oscillator. This can be helpful when you want to create a one-oscillator sound, or to temporarily disable an oscillator, so that you can focus on shaping the sound of the other.</li>
                                                    <li value="2"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Oscillator Waveform </span>Choose between Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, or Square.</li>
                                                    <li value="3"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">PWM </span>Only available when Square Wave is selected, this control lets you vary the pulse width of the square wave, changing the distribution of harmonics, and thus, the tone of the oscillator.</li>
                                                    <li value="4"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Octave </span>Lets you set the frequency range, in octaves, for the current oscillator. Range is set in number of feet (like a pipe in a pipe organ), so the lower the number, the higher the pitch.</li>
                                                    <li value="5"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Random Phase (RP)</span> Enable this option to set the oscillator to Random Phase mode, in which, when a note is played, the oscillator starts its waveform at a random start point. This establishes a varying phase relationship between both oscillators whenever a note is played (if both oscs are enabled), which creates pleasing shifts in tone over time. Disable this option to restart the waveform at the beginning when a note is played, which can be preferable when creating percussive sounds, because it allows a uniformity of attack, from note to note.</li>
                                                    <li value="6"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Semi and Fine</span> These controls let you set the center pitch of the oscillator, in semitones (Semi) and cents (Fine).</li>
                                                    <li value="7"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Spread (Osc 1 only</span>) This control lets you layer in additional oscillators that follow Osc 1 pitch, with increasing amounts of detuning as more oscillators are blended in. This creates a richer, fuller sound. With Spread all the way to the left, you hear a single oscillator. As you turn Spread to the right, more oscillators are added, with greater detuning and stereo spread.</li>
                                                    <li value="8"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Sync (Osc 2 only)</span> Enable this option to restart Osc 2's waveform each time Osc 1's waveform repeats. This is a classic analog synthesis technique, creating rich harmonics and a sharp and strident sound. This is further expanded when pitch modulation is applied to one or both of the oscillators with an LFO or envelope.</li>

This type of filter allows frequencies below the chosen Cutoff frequency to pass through, which cutting frequencies above Cutoff at a rate of 24 decibels per octave—a fairly aggressive slope.</li><li value="2"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">LP 24dB Zero</span> This is a 24dB-per-octave low-pass filter, based on a zero-delay-feedback architecture that closely models the tone and modulation behavior of analog filters. </li><li value="3"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">LP 12dB Ladder</span> This is a low-pass filter with a 12dB-per-octave curve, which cuts frequencies less aggressively than the 24dB filters. </li><li value="4"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">BP 12db Ladder</span> This is a high-pass and low-pass filter in series, known collectively as a band-pass filter. It allows a selected band of frequencies to pass through, then cuts frequencies above and below that band at a rate of 12 decibels per octave. </li><li value="5"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">HP 12dB Ladder</span> This is a high-pass filter with a 12db-per-octave slope. This lets frequencies above the chosen Cutoff frequency pass through, while cutting frequencies below Cutoff at a rate of 12 decibels per octave.</li></ul></li>
                                                    <li value="3"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Cutoff </span>This lets you set the corner frequency of the filter—the point in the slope of the filter at which the filter cuts incoming audio by 3dB. In the case of the Band-Pass filter, this sets the center frequency of the passed frequency band.</li>
                                                    <li value="4"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Soft</span> This control lets you switch between two differing analog-modeled processing circuits within the filter. Engage Soft for a mellower, darker tone. Disengage it for a brighter, more aggressive sound.</li>
                                                    <li value="5"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Drive </span>This lets you specify an amount of filter overdrive, to add fullness and saturation artifacts to your sound. </li>
                                                    <li value="6"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Punch </span>This control lets you add a range of percussive attack to the start of each note. At the lowest setting, dynamics are unchanged. At higher settings, the sound becomes more aggressive and more readily pops through the mix.</li>
                                                    <li value="7"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Resonance (Res)</span> This lets you set the amount of resonance in the filter, which is an emphasis centered on the chosen cutoff frequency. At lower settings, the filter cuts frequencies smoothly. As you increase Res, the emphasis at the cutoff frequency becomes more pronounced, able to mimic resonances such as those in voices or acoustic instruments, as well as many classic synthesis effects. At the highest settings, the filter can self-oscillate, emitting a pitched tone at the current cutoff frequency. This filter oscillation can be treated somewhat like an extra oscillator, especially in conjunction with the Key parameter.</li>
                                                    <li value="8"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Velocity (Vel)</span> This control sets the relationship between incoming Voice Velocity and filter Cutoff. When set at the center, velocity does not effect cutoff. When moved to the right, cutoff rises as note velocity increases. When moved to the left, cutoff lowers as note velocity increases.</li>
                                                    <li value="9"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Key </span>This control sets the relationship between incoming Voice Pitch and filter Cutoff. In physical instruments, higher notes tend to produce higher harmonics, brightening slightly as you go up the scale. On a synthesized instrument, if the filter stays static, setting the proper tone in the lower note ranges may cause inappropriate dullness in the higher notes. So, with the Key parameter, we can compensate for this, and create a more natural-sounding range of timbres up and down the keyboard.<ul><li value="1">When Key is set all the way to the left, the filter is unaffected by note pitch. In the middle, cutoff follows note pitch subtly, allowing high notes to shine. When set all the way right, filter cutoff follows note pitch closely in a relative fashion, moving upward and downward in semitone values as notes are received. This lets you use the filter as an additional pitched oscillator or resonator when filter Res is set high.

Standard oscillators are used mainly to create audible pitched tones, LFOs create slow-moving  regular cycles of control signal that are useful for modulating other parameters over time. One common example is the way many synth patches respond when you move the Mod Wheel up from zero; the pitch of the oscillators wavers up and down in an expressive manner, much like the sound of vocal vibrato. This is simply an LFO modulating oscillator pitch to a degree set by the position of the mod wheel.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Mai Tai provides 16 configurable modulation routings, in two banks of eight (Mod A and Mod B). Modulation signals can be routed from a selection of incoming MIDI controller signals (such as Pitch Bend, Mod Wheel, and Aftertouch), modulation generators (such as the LFOs and envelopes), or the pitch or velocity of played notes.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">These modulation signals can be used to vary most of the parameters throughout Mai Tai, including modulation sources themselves (such as LFO 2 modulating the rate of LFO 1, or the Decay of Env 2)</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Each modulation slot has a bypass button at the top, which lets you enable or disable the flow of modulation signal. Below that are the input selector and modifier selector. If you assign a modulation source to the input selector only, that signal is routed directly to the chosen destination. In some cases, you’ll want to govern the flow of one mod source before it reaches its destination, using the signal from another mod source. For example, you may want to control the output level of LFO 1 (routed to a parameter such as oscillator pitch) with the Mod Wheel. In this case, you'd choose Mod Wheel with the input selector, and LFO 1 with the modifier selector below.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Below that is a slider that controls the amplitude and polarity of the modulation signal. Set at its center, no modulation occurs. Move the handle right of center to send an increasing amount of the modulation signal, at its normal (positive) polarity, to the chosen destination. Move it left of center to send the signal to its destination with a negative value. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If the parameter you wish to modulate is set to a high value, you may want to send a negative modulation signal to it, driving the setting downward and causing more audible effects. Positive-going modulation signals are more efficient when modulating parameters set to low values.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">A selector at the bottom of each modulation slot lets you choose the destination of the chosen modulation signals.</p>
