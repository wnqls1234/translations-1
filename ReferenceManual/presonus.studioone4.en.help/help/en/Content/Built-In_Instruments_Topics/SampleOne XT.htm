C3 is set by default as the sample’s root note, so playing the C3 (middle C) key on your keyboard  plays the sample at its original pitch and speed.

Lower settings create slow, sweeping effects, while higher settings create faster, more aggressive modulation. </li><li value="4"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Width </span>This control lets you set the degree to which the delay line is modulated.

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">This is a rhythmic gating effect, able to create a series of syncopated breaks in the synth signal. A variety of presets are provided, each with a different rhythmic gating pattern. However, the fun really begins when you create your own. Gater offers the following controls:</p>
                                                <ul data-mc-conditions="General.Online">
                                                    <li value="1"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Beats </span>This control lets you set the length of the gating cycle, in rhythmic values (such as 1 bar or 1/2-note) relative to Song tempo. For example, at a setting of 1 bar, the 16 steps in the cycle  repeat every bar, effectively representing 16th-notes. At a 1/2-note setting, the 16 steps  repeat each half-bar, representing 32nd-note values.</li>
                                                    <li value="2"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Beat Steps</span> This grid lets you specify which steps in the cycle  let signal pass through, and which  gate the signal to silence. Click on a step to enable or disable gating for that step.</li>
                                                    <li value="3"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Stereo</span> Engaging this option creates a separate beat grid for each side of the stereo field. When engaged, you'll see two rows of beat steps, the top row specifying gate steps for the left channel, and the bottom row gating the right channel.</li>
                                                    <li value="4"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Depth</span> This control lets you blend between the gated and dry signals, allowing for rhythmic gating effects while retaining the continuity of the synth sound.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <h5 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">EQ</h5>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">This is a graphic equalizer effect, perfect for quick tonal shaping. Set the EQ bands to emphasize or attenuate bands of frequencies to suit your needs. When a band is in the center of its range, it neither adds nor subtracts. When moved above the center, it emphasizes the chosen frequency. Moved below the center, it attenuates that frequency. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Choose between Lead mode, with frequencies chosen to suit aggressive, up-front sounds, or Bass mode, with wider-ranging frequencies that  work better for basses and mellower chordal parts.</p>
                                                <h5 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Distortion</h5>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">This is a variable distortion effect, which adds grit and character to your sounds. Choose from a variety of distortion types, from fizzy transistor fuzzes to thick, warm tube overdrives. Set the amount of distortion with the Drive knob.</p>
                                                <h5 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Pan </h5>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">This is an auto-pan effect, which pans the synth signal left and right over time. Pan offers the following controls:</p>
                                                <ul data-mc-conditions="General.Online">
                                                    <li value="1"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Speed </span>This control lets you set the speed at which the signal is panned left and right.</li>
                                                    <li value="2"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Sync </span>Enable this option to set pan speed to a rhythmic value (such as 1/4-note or 16th-note) relative to Song tempo. Disable this option to set pan speed along a continuous range.</li>
                                                    <li value="3"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Depth </span>This control lets you set the degree to which the signal is panned. Lower settings give a subtly panned effect, while higher settings pan the signal more radically, all the way to fully left and right in each cycle.</li>
                                                </ul>

The keyboard display also shows you which notes are currently being played, as well as the root note and pitch mapping span of the currently selected sample. You can show or hide the virtual keyboard at any time by pressing the [Keys] button.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Next to the virtual keyboard is the Bend parameter, which lets you set the  pitch bend range of the Pitch wheel, in semitones. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Given that it's so easy to create new sample libraries in SampleOne XT, you may find that you want to exchange them with other people, or use them in different instruments, such as Presence XT. To export the current set of samples as a .multisample file, click the menu button and choose <span class="Emphasis">Export Multisample File...</span> To export the current patch as a .soundx file for other SampleOne XT users to try, click the menu button and choose <span class="Emphasis">Export Preset...</span> To import a multisample or soundx preset file into SampleOne XT, simply drag-and-drop it onto the plug-in window.</p>

To do this, click and drag your chosen sample from the sample list in SampleOne XT, and hover your cursor over an Impact XT tab at the top of the Instruments window. Impact XT is then shown, and you can drop your sample onto any pad. You can also select multiple samples in SampleOne XT, then click and drag the group into Impact XT as described above. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">By default, when multiple samples are dropped onto a pad, they are all assigned to that pad and are played interchangably, according to the current Layer Mode. To distribute multiple samples across multiple pads, press and hold [Shift] before dropping them. The first sample is assigned to the selected pad, and each subsequent sample is assigned to subsequent pads in ascending note order.</p>
