                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Presence XT is a virtual sample-player instrument that enables you to play an endless variety of sounds. Presence XT uses a generic multisample format (also supported by Bitwig&#160;Studio) packaged into Sound Sets, and can also load and play presets in EXS, Giga, Kontakt (version 4 and below), and SoundFont formats. The bundled Sound Sets include a variety of high-quality instruments. You can shape your sounds with the provided filter, LFOs, envelopes, mod matrix, and effects.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">While Presence XT is, by default, limited to playing sounds from existing libraries, by purchasing  the Presence XT&#160;Editor Option, you can upgrade it to a full-featured sampler. With this option installed, you can create your own sample-based instruments, with powerful layering and scripting features. For more information, see <a href="#Presence">Presence XT Editor</a>.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Presence XT employs a high-performance disk-streaming sample playback system, enabling the use of presets that use very long samples. Up to 128 sample voices can play simultaneously. One voice is often equivalent to one note. However, some sounds have elements (such as layers and articulations) that can consume more than one voice per note played. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The central preset display shows the number of sample voices being used at any moment, as well as the name and size of the loaded preset. The Voice Limit parameter lets you set the level of polyphony you want (1-128, 64 by default). </p>

This difference can be minimized by adjusting the settings of the new <a href="#Reverb">Reverb effect</a>.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">You may still notice some slight sound differences between presets played through Presence and the same presets played through Presence XT.

Songs saved in this state  sound exactly the same when opened in <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> <span class="GeneralVersionNumberShort">4.5</span>.</p>

You can load these presets by dragging from the Windows Explorer or Mac OS Finder onto the plug-in window, or onto a Track with Presence XT loaded. You can create a new Instrument Track with Presence XT and your choice of preset already loaded, by dragging the preset between two Tracks (or next to the top or bottom Track) in Arrange view.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">You can also locate and access 3rd-party presets using the Files tab in the Browser.

Each sample in any given preset can have different absolute settings. Expressive control of such complex presets is achieved by the use of relative controls, that can modify all samples simultaneously. Changes are made relative to the absolute settings within the loaded preset. </p>

LFOs create slow-moving regular cycles of control signal that are useful for modulating other parameters over time. One common example is the way many keyboard patches respond when you move the Mod Wheel up from zero; the pitch of the oscillators wavers up and down in an expressive manner, much like the sound of vocal vibrato. This is simply an LFO modulating oscillator pitch to a degree set by the position of the mod wheel.</p>

This type of filter allows frequencies below the chosen Cutoff frequency to pass through, which cutting frequencies above Cutoff at a rate of 24 decibels per octave—a fairly aggressive slope.</li>

At lower settings, the filter cuts frequencies smoothly. As you increase Res, the emphasis at the cutoff frequency becomes more pronounced, able to mimic resonances such as those in voices or acoustic instruments, as well as many classic synthesis effects. At the highest settings, the filter can self-oscillate, emitting a pitched tone at the current cutoff frequency. This filter oscillation can be treated somewhat like an extra oscillator, especially in conjunction with the Key parameter.</li>
                                                    <li value="8"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Velocity (Vel)</span> This control sets the relationship between incoming note Velocity and filter Cutoff. When set at the center, velocity does not affect cutoff. When moved to the right, cutoff rises as note velocity increases. When moved to the left, cutoff lowers as note velocity increases.</li>
                                                    <li value="9"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Key </span>This control sets the relationship between incoming note Pitch and filter Cutoff. In physical instruments, higher notes tend to produce higher harmonics, brightening slightly as you go up the scale. On a synthesized instrument, if the filter stays static, setting the proper tone in the lower note ranges may cause inappropriate dullness in the higher notes. So, with the Key parameter, we can compensate for this, and create a more natural-sounding range of timbres up and down the keyboard.
				<ul><li value="1">When Key is set all the way to the left, the filter is unaffected by note pitch. In the middle, cutoff follows note pitch subtly, allowing high notes to shine. When set all the way right, filter cutoff follows note pitch closely in a relative fashion, moving upward and downward in semitone values as notes are received. This lets you use the filter as an additional pitched oscillator or resonator when filter Res is set high.</li></ul></li>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Presence XT provides 16 configurable modulation routings, in two banks of eight (Mod A and Mod B). Modulation signals can be routed from a selection of incoming MIDI controller signals (such as Pitch Bend, Mod Wheel, and Aftertouch), modulation generators (such as the LFOs and envelopes), or the pitch or velocity of played notes.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">These modulation signals can be used to vary most of the parameters throughout Presence XT, including modulation sources themselves (such as LFO 2 modulating the rate of LFO 1, or the Decay of Env 2).</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Each modulation slot has a bypass button at the top, which lets you enable or disable the flow of modulation signal. Below that are the input selector and modifier selector. If you assign a modulation source to the input selector only, that signal is routed directly to the chosen destination. In some cases, you’ll want to govern the flow of one mod source before it reaches its destination, using the signal from another mod source. For example, you may want to control the output level of LFO 1 (routed to a parameter such as oscillator pitch) with the Mod Wheel. In this case, you'd choose Mod Wheel with the input selector, and LFO 1 with the modifier selector below.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Below that is a slider that controls the amplitude and polarity of the modulation signal. Set at its center, no modulation occurs. Move the handle right of center to send an increasing amount of the modulation signal, at its normal (positive) polarity, to the chosen destination. Move it left of center to send the signal to its destination with a negative value. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If the parameter you wish to modulate is set to a high value, you may want to send a negative modulation signal to it, driving the setting downward and causing more audible effects. Positive-going modulation signals are more efficient when modulating parameters set to low values.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">A selector at the bottom of each modulation slot lets you choose the destination of the chosen modulation signals.</p>
