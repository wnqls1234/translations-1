If you want to create your own sample-based instruments, you can purchase and install the Presence&#160;XT Editor Add-on, available from the <a href="http://shop.presonus.com/">PreSonus Shop</a>. This option upgrades Presence XT to full sampler functionality, with powerful scripting and layering features.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">This editing function can also be used to deeply change and further optimize programs from imported sound libraries (such as those in EXS&#160;or Giga format), or Presence XT libraries created by other users. Commercial Presence XT libraries (such as those included with <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> or bought separately) are protected, and cannot be edited.</p>

Press this button to open the editing interface. To return to the normal view, click the [Player] button. You'll notice there are four main sections in the editing interface:</p>
                                                <h5 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Program</h5>

                                                <ul>
                                                    <li value="1" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">New Program</span> Resets Presence XT to a default state, with a blank program loaded. If you've begun to create a program and have not yet saved it, you'll receive a warning, telling you that your samples and parameter settings will be lost if you go through with creating a new program.</li>
                                                    <li value="2" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Pack Program</span> Lets you package your program, with all its samples and settings, into a single file, for easy storage and sharing. Packed programs are created with a ".soundx"&#160;file extension.</li>
                                                    <li value="3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><span class="SetOffFirstLevel">Set Program Password</span> Lets you set a password that Presence XT prompts for if a person attempts to edit this program. This lets you keep a program from being edited, even when sharing it with others.</li>
                                                </ul>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To the right of the program area, you'll see three buttons that control the editor display. They look like this:</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">
                                                    <img src="../Resources/Images/StudioOneImages/PresenceEditorWindowControls.png" />
                                                </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The first button shows or hides an information drawer at the top of the editor window. Here, you can edit the program's name, set its category, and add a description and information about yourself, as author of the program. The information you enter here is shown in the Player view when your program is loaded, so we recommend you always fill in these fields.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The second and third buttons arrange the Layers and Zones areas either side-by-side, or vertically stacked, according to your preference.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Finally, you'll see the [Script] button, which opens the scripting view, in which you can write scripts in JavaScript, for greater creative control and interface flexibility in your programs. For more information on working with JavaScript in Presence XT, see <a href="#Scriptin">Scripting</a>.</p>
                                                <h5 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Layer </h5>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">This area deals with Layers, which are entire sample sets, arranged in Zones (as discussed below) across the range of MIDI key and velocity values. These layers can be combined to create fuller sounds and textures, or to set up one or more MIDI-switchable variations&#160;for a given sound. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">For example, a layer could be a single variation, such as "Pizzicato,"&#160;in a string sound (made up of many layers), with multiple sample zones spread across the keyboard, horizontally. Or, a layer could be a single drum instrument, such as a snare drum, containing multiple velocity zones, stacked vertically on a single MIDI&#160;note. For more information on working with the layer functions, see <a href="#Layers">Layers</a>.</p>
                                                <h5 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Zones </h5>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">This area deals with Zones, which are areas in which a single sample is placed across the range of MIDI&#160;key and velocity values. These sample zones are the pieces that make up a layer (as discussed above), letting you decide exactly how your samples are placed, played, and processed.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">For example, a high-quality piano sound may have a group of separate samples for every note on the piano, arranged to be played at low, mid, or high velocity. In the Zones area, you can make decisions like this with your own samples, setting up the range of the keyboard and key velocity in which each sample plays, along with many other options. For more information on working with zones, see <a href="#Zones">Zones</a>.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Clicking the [Program], [Layer], or [Zones] button changes the focus of the Parameters area to address each of those categories, as needed. You can also switch the mode of the parameters area between these three settings by clicking the [Parameters] button.  You can easily keep track of which mode you're in, because the Parameters area is color-coded:&#160;Program mode is blue, Layers is red, and Zones is turquoise.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To get started creating a new program, open an instance of Presence XT and click the [Editor] button to open the editing interface. A blank preset is shown by default. It has a single layer, and no samples yet placed in zones. You can then begin dragging samples from the Browser into the Zones area on the Presence XT window. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Looking at the Zones area, you can see the samples you add to your new program. By default, they are displayed in a list-style view, showing the sample name and a variety of available parameters for each. If you click the [Grid] button, you'll see the samples displayed along a grid that represents the full range of MIDI&#160;notes (horizontally) and velocity values (vertically). You can get back to the list view at any time by clicking the [List] button.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The first sample you add defaults to playing on MIDI&#160;note C-1, the second defaults to C#-1, and so on, in ascending order. This can be helpful when creating drum programs or heavily multisampled sounds, where each key may have a sample of its own. If you intend for a sample to cover a larger span of keys, you can specify the desired span using the Key Low and Key High parameters for each sample (if looking at zones in list view) or by dragging the edges of each sample to the beginning and end of the desired range (if looking at zones in grid view).</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Once you have the start to a new sound in place, you'll probably want to save the preset, to preserve your work.

Layers are entire sound sets, with samples placed in zones, and most of the necessary sample-by-sample decisions already made (such as key and velocity ranges, processing details, and so on). You can add multiple layers to your program, to create hybrid sounds that play together, or provide MIDI-selectable variations on a given sound, such as different bowing and plucking styles in a violin sound. </p>

When you select Round Robin values for overlapping zones, they switch places with successive plays of a note, according to the order of the numbers you specify. This can help to introduce natural-sounding variations from note to note, especially in sounds made from samples of live instruments. Type "random"&#160;into this field for any set of overlapping key zones, and those samples will play in random order as keys are struck, rather than numerical.</li>

While editing in this "spreadsheet" style can be fast and precise, sometimes it can be helpful to use the type of knobs, buttons, and displays you're used to in the Player mode to help set and visualize these parameters. The Parameters area of the editor window lets you set many of the available parameters in this way.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Parameters area can show controls for the program as a whole (all layers and zones, together), or for one or more selected layers (and the zones they contain), or for one or more selected zones. You can choose to display parameters for each by clicking the [Program], [Layer], or [Zones] button, or cycle through them by clicking the [Parameters] button. You can easily keep track of which mode you're in, because the Parameters area is color-coded:&#160;Program mode is blue, Layers is red, and Zones is turquoise.</p>

Clicking this brings up a waveform display for the sample in the selected zone. Click and drag along the top edge to set the loop range for the displayed sample. Click and drag at the beginning or end of the sample to move the play start or end point for the displayed sample.</p>
                                                <p>While loop editing is possible in this fashion, it lacks the control and accuracy of a dedicated wave editor. As a result, clicks and pops may appear when changing loop start and end points in this display. Adding a loop crossfade may solve this problem. This waveform display is mainly meant for monitoring or reference. If in-depth loop editing is required, a dedicated wave editor software should be used. </p>

We chose this language because it is well supported and documented, and known by many. Scripting can be used to affect many functions in a program, most notably to assign macro knobs and buttons to your choice of parameters. Once script controls are assigned here, these controls appear in the central display in the Player mode of the Presence XT window. </p>

By default, it looks blank. To enable a control, click the dot-shaped button in its lower left corner. To rename a control, click the pencil-shaped button that appears when you hover the mouse cursor over the control. The functions that these controls relate to are set in the script that you create.</p>
