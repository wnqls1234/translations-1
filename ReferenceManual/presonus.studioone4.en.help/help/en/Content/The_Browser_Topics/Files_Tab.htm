                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When an audio file is selected in the Browser, the bottom window of the Browser becomes the Preview Player, displaying transport controls and information about the selected file. When the Preview Player appears, you can listen to the selected file directly within the Browser. To start file playback, double-click on the file in the Browser or click on the Play button in the Preview Player with the desired file selected. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Preview Player playback is independent of the main Song playback,  notice the playback-position cursor does not move across the Arrange view while previewing a file. The Preview Player has its own playback-position indicator that moves left to right to indicate the current playback position in the selected file. The position indicator can be clicked-and-dragged to navigate through the selected file during playback. A volume fader controls the playback level of the Preview Player. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Preview Player playback can be synced to Song playback to allow auditioning of files along with Song playback. Click on the Play at Song Tempo button, which is engaged by default, to allow the Preview Player to sync to the current Song tempo. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If the currently selected file’s tempo is known, and Play at Song Tempo is engaged while previewing, the file is timestretched on the fly to match the current Song tempo. To preview while hearing your Song, start Song playback first, and then select a file to preview. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To loop the selected file during preview playback, click on the Preview Player’s Loop button, which is engaged by default. Looping during preview playback makes it easy to listen to the selected file in the context of your Song. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">An easy way to audition many audio loops from a single folder, such as a loop library, is to set the left and right locators around the range of the Song into which you plan to import the loop, then loop playback in the Transport within that range. Next, preview the first loop in the folder and then use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to cycle through the loops in that folder. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Importing an audio file from the Browser into your Song is as easy as clicking on the file and dragging it into the Arrange view of the Song. When the file is dragged to empty space, a mono or stereo Audio Track is created with the file placed on it as a new Audio Event, located at the position to which it was dragged. When the file is dragged to an existing Audio Track, it is placed as a new Audio Event on that Track, at the position to which it was dragged. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If you import a stereo file to a mono Track, the Event created is stereo, but the output is mono, since the Track is mono. If you import a mono file to a stereo Track, the output is dual mono, that is, the same signal equally on both sides. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If you wish to replace the audio clip associated with an Event with another audio clip from the Browser, you can hold [Alt]/[Opt] while you drag-and-drop the new audio onto the Event to be replaced. This  effectively swaps out the existing audio with the new audio, and the edits to the Event stay intact.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is possible to select multiple files in the Browser and drag all of them in at once, making the transfer of recordings done in another DAW a one-click process. If you would like to insert multiple audio clips, selected in the browser, to the same Track, with one placed after the other across the timeline, hold [Ctrl]/[Cmd] while dragging the audio clips to empty space on a Track. This can be helpful if you want to quickly drag in multiple variations of similar audio, or for laying out an entire song structure in one move.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">For virtual instruments that support audio-file importing using drag-and-drop (such as many drum samplers), you can drag-and-drop audio files from the Browser directly onto the instruments to load audio files. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">You can also [Right]/[Ctrl]-click on any audio file and select Send to New SampleOne to instantly load the file as a sample in the built-in SampleOne™ virtual instrument. If you do this with an Audio Loop or REX audio file, its slices are automatically mapped across the keyboard (up to 96 slices). </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When you import an MP3 file into a Song, or any other file type, it is automatically converted to a WAV file. The WAV file created during conversion is stored in the Media folder of the Song in which the file was imported and has the same name as the original file, with the .wav file extension. The newly created WAV file inherits the Song’s sample rate and resolution (bit depth), as set in <span class="Italic">Song/Song Setup</span>. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To import a MIDI file using the Browser, navigate to the desired file, as you would for an audio file, and click-and-drag it into your Song. If the MIDI file is dragged to an empty space in the Arrange view, a new Instrument Track is created with that file placed on the Track at the position to which it was dragged. If the file is dragged to an existing MIDI Track, the file is placed as a new Instrument Part on the Track, at the position to which it was dragged. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Some MIDI files contain more than one MIDI Part in the sequence. If this is the case, a drop-down arrow is shown next to the file in the Browser. You can click the drop-down arrow to reveal the independent Parts. If you drag in a file with multiple Parts, they are shown when dragging the file into your Song. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">As with all Instrument Tracks, you  need to ensure that the new Instrument Track is routed to a virtual or external instrument in order to hear the new Instrument Part.

If you know you want constant access to such folders in the Browser, you can create Tabs for these locations. By default, there are two Tabs at the top of the File Browser, called “Files" and "<span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>". The Files tab gives you access to the entire file structure of your computer, and the <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> tab shows you the User Data location as set in the <span class="Italic"><span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>/Options/Locations/User Data</span> menu (Mac OS&#160;X: <span class="Italic">Preferences/Locations/User Data</span>).</p>
