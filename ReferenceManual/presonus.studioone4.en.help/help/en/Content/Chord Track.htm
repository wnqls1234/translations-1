                                                <img src="Resources/Images/StudioOneImages/Chord Track_888x503.png" style="width: 888;height: 503;" />
                                            </p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">The Chord Track is a global track (similar to the <a href="Arranging_Topics/ArrangerTrack.htm">Arranger track</a>) that provides the ability to perform "harmonic editing" of both Instrument and Audio Parts. This restructuring of chord progressions can affect an entire song, or only the Tracks of your choice. This lets you write musical content with a chord progression that appeals at the time, and make sweeping changes later, without exhaustive editing or re-recording of Parts. </p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Want to modulate that final chorus for a little extra push of energy, or rethink the harmonic structure of a composition in progress? The Chord Track lets you try these sorts of changes on a whim.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">While the Chord Track is capable of very powerful effects, it does have its limits, primarily in that audio cannot be pitch-shifted without some level of artifacts added. We recommend that once you're done experimenting and "prototyping"&#160;your song, you re-record any audio parts to fit the new chord progression, especially if they are critical parts.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">To show or hide the Chord Track, click this button, above the arrangement view:&#160;<img src="Resources/Images/StudioOneImages/ChordTrackButton_27x29.png" style="width: 27;height: 29;" /> To toggle the effect of the Chord Track on or off for all affected Tracks, click the [Follow: On/Off] button.</p>
                                            <h3 data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Getting Started with the Chord Track</h3>

                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">First, set the key signature of the song to ensure proper chord display in the Chord Track. To do this, click the [Key] button in the Transport and select the key of your choice from the pop-up selector that appears.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">You can also automatically derive the key signature of your song from any Instrument Part.&#160;To do so, select the Part, then navigate to <span class="Italic">Event/Detect Key Signature</span> (or [Right]/[Ctrl]-click the Part and navigate to <span class="Italic">Instrument Parts/Detect Key Signature</span> in the pop-up menu that appears).</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Once you've set your key signature, you can begin to populate the Chord Track with chords. This can be done manually, or by automatically detecting the chord structure of your song from its Instrument or Audio Parts. </p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">If any one Instrument or Audio Part in your Song contains musical content that spans the entire length of the Song, you can use that Part alone to auto-detect the chord progression. Otherwise, you may find it useful to export a mixdown of your song, re-import the mixdown to an Audio Track, and use that track as the basis for <a href="#Extracti">chord detection</a>. Once that's done, you can remove the mixdown Track.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Next, we'll learn how to add, delete, and edit chords in the Chord Track.</p>

                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">To add chords manually, select the Paint tool (or hold [Ctrl] to select it temporarily) and click inside the Chord Track. You can also add a chord by double-clicking in the Chord Track with the Arrow tool. </p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Each new chord section you add is one bar long by default, or the length of the current selection in the timeline. You can change the length of a chord by clicking one of its ends and dragging it to the desired length. If adding chords with the Paint tool, you can also click-and-drag in the Chord Track to create longer chords.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Once you've added a chord, you can change it to a different chord or variation in a variety of ways. Try double-clicking a chord to open the Chord Selector. This window lets you choose from all of the major chord types and extensions. Keep in mind that the Chord Track cannot add notes to chords played in affected Parts. It can only shift the notes that exist. If you want to select a chord with 7, 9, 11 or other extensions, you will only hear those notes if the chords in your Parts contain four or more notes.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">If you enable the Instrument Input option by clicking this button&#160;<img src="Resources/Images/StudioOneImages/InstrumentInputChordSelector_31x28.png" style="width: 31;height: 28;" />, you can play a chord on any connected MIDI&#160;keyboard to change the selected chord. The Chord Selector then shows you the name of the chord you've played, and the current chord changes to match. With Instrument Input enabled, you also can select one or more chords in the Chord Track and play any chord shape on a MIDI keyboard to change all selected chords.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">When you're done editing a chord, you can close the Chord Selector, or select another chord in the Chord Track and continue editing. </p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">To delete one or more chords from the Chord Track, select them and press the [Delete] or [Backspace] key on your keyboard.</p>
                                            <h4 data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Extracting Chords from Instrument Parts</h4>

                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">One simple way to get familiar with the Chord Track is to populate it with the chord structure from one or more Instrument Parts. [Right]/[Ctrl]-click on a Part (or multiple selected Parts)&#160;in the timeline, then choose [Extract to Chord Track]. This function analyzes the musical relationships of the notes in the selected content, and fills the Chord Track with the chords it recognizes.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">You can also simply drag selected Instrument Parts (single or multiple, across as many Tracks as you like) onto the Chord Track to extract their shared chord progressions. This is one easy way to detect chords across a large area of your Song, especially if you're using different Instrument Tracks (with distinct instruments and sound)&#160;in each section.</p>

                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Some audio data doesn't lend itself to easy automatic chord detection, and if the wrong chords are detected, harmonic changes made in the Chord Track may not bring the desired result. If you find that one or more of your audio tracks do not show the proper chords after using Detect Chords, here is a good way to get around that:</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">First, detect the chords for that section of the song from another source that detects more accurately. If no Instrument or Audio Parts seem to work, you can try entering the chords manually, or with a MIDI&#160;keyboard.  Then, select the Audio Part that you could not accurately analyze, and navigate to <span class="Italic">Audio/Apply Chords from Chord Track</span> (or [Right]/[Ctrl]-click the Part and navigate to <span class="Italic">Audio/Apply Chords from Chord Track</span> in the pop-up menu). This applies the chord designations from the Chord Track to that Audio Part, ensuring that when it is pitch-shifted during harmonic editing, its notes are shifted more accurately. </p>

                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Once you've populated the Chord Track with chords, you may find it helpful to quantize the start positions of those chords. To do so, select the chords you want to quantize, and navigate to <span class="Italic">Event/Quantize/Quantize on Track</span>.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Often, chord changes do not happen precisely on-beat, especially when working with live recorded audio. After quantizing chords, you may find it helpful to subtly shift the start and end positions of each chord to minimize unnatural shifting behavior and better match the movement of the performance.</p>

                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Now that you have chords in the Chord Track, and some Instrument and Audio Parts to go with them (with Follow Chords modes selected), it's time to get into some harmonic editing. To do this, simply select one or more chords in the Chord Track, and change them in one of the ways described in <a href="#Entering" class="MCXref xref">Entering and Editing Chords Manually</a>. You can play in a chord on a connected MIDI&#160;keyboard, double-click a chord to change it with the Chord Selector, or change its parameters in the Inspector. You can add, delete, and change the lengths of each chord to suit the changes you wish to make.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">You can also shift the root note of one or more chords by selecting the chords, holding [Alt]/[Opt]. and moving the scroll wheel on your pointing device (or using the scroll gesture on your trackpad).</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">As you experiment with harmonic editing, you may notice that certain chords cause undesired results on certain tracks, whether simply creating unpleasant note movement, or with audio, unwanted pitch-shifting artifacts. To help alleviate these issues, feel free to try the various Follow Chords and Tune Modes, or simply tweak the chords in the Chord Track. Sometimes adding additional intervals or changing to a different Bass note can make all the difference.</p>
                                            <p data-mc-conditions="General.S1ProfessionalOnly">Remember that you can always switch the effects of the Chord Track on or off for the entire song at once by toggling the [Follow: On/Off] button, to the left of the Chord Track.</p>
