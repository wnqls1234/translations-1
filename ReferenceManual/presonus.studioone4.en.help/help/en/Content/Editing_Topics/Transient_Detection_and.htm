                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Transient Detection is the process of determining the location of transients within audio material, which can then be used as the basis for editing. A transient can be defined as a short-duration signal that represents a non-harmonic attack phase of a musical sound or spoken word. It contains a high degree of non-periodic components and a higher magnitude of high frequencies than the harmonic content of that sound. When looking at the waveform of a recorded snare drum hit, the first part of the hit—the attack—looks distinctly louder than the rest of the signal; the “louder” part is the transient, and the rest of the signal is commonly called the “tail.” </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Transients usually indicate rhythm in musical material, so that when the positions of transients are known, it becomes possible to quantize, or correct the timing of, recorded audio. For instance, if a drummer was early on the downbeat after a killer fill, you could fix it so that it is perfectly in time. In fact, it is possible to alter the entire feel of a performance and even extract the feel of one recorded performance and apply it to another.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To detect transients in any audio in an arrangement, select an Audio Event and open the Bend panel from the top toolbar, then choose Analyze from the Detection area. Alternatively, [Right]/[Ctrl]-click on an Audio Event and choose Detect Transients from the<span class="Italic"> Audio/Audio Bend</span> contextual menu. You can also open the Bend panel by clicking Audio Bend in the <span class="Italic">View/Additional Views</span> menu.</p>

After detection, the Event  becomes slightly translucent, and blue Bend Markers—vertical lines the height of the Event—are placed at every transient.</p>

This  moves the playback cursor to the next transient in the Event. The following keyboard shortcuts are also available when working with Tab to Transient:</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Bend Markers are used in <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> to stretch audio inside an Audio Event, without the need for slicing the Event into multiple pieces. They are added to an Audio Event when detecting transients from the Bend Panel, and can also be manually added. When detecting transients, the default Threshold used to placed Bend Markers at transients is 80%, which can be adjusted at the top of the Event contextual menu or in the Inspector, so that Bend Markers are placed only at the transients with which you want to work. It is also possible to manually insert Bend Markers, before or after detecting transients. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">While it is possible to insert and edit Bend Markers with Bend Markers hidden, you may want them to be shown while editing. Check the Show Bend Markers box in the Bend panel or Event contextual menu to show or hide Bend Markers. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If Bend Markers have been inserted as the result of transient detection, a very short, highlighted range—visible if zoomed in far enough—precedes the Bend Marker. This range represents the distance between the onset and the peak of the transient, and it is important when <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> quantizes audio based on Bend Markers. When cutting, the onset of the transient is used, so as to encompass the whole transient. When quantizing or snapping a Bend Marker, the peaks of the transient are referenced, for better rhythmic accuracy.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Note that Bend Markers are properties of the audio clip that an Event references, meaning that multiple Events referencing the same audio clip in the Pool (for example, a drum loop duplicated several times)  share the same Bend Markers, and are effected by any Bend Marker editing. If you want to process duplicated Events differently, for instance to provide rhythmic variation with a duplicated drum loop, then bounce the Event to a new file prior to editing.</p>
                                                <h4 class="Heading4" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Editing Bend Markers</h4>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To manually insert Bend Markers, switch to the Bend tool, then float the mouse over any Audio Event and click where you would like to insert the Bend Marker. Double-click on any Bend Marker with the Bend tool to remove it; any effect the Marker had on the audio is undone. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">With the Bend tool selected, click-and-drag on any Bend Marker to manually manipulate the audio left or right on the timeline. Doing so  stretches or compresses the audio surrounding the Bend Marker, and the Bend Marker  displays a left- or right-facing flag at the bottom, indicating the direction in which it has been moved. If the audio is stretched, the waveform is colored red, with the intensity of the color increasing the more the audio is stretched. If the audio is compressed, the waveform is colored green. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is very simple to quantize audio in <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>. Select the Audio Event, then press [Q] on the keyboard to quantize. Transients are detected for the selected Event, the audio  instantly snaps to the current quantize grid, the Bend Markers  indicate they have been moved left or right, and the waveforms are  appropriately colored as described in the <a href="#_6.9.2.1_Editing_Bend">Editing Bend Markers</a> section. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The same quantize commands are available for transient-detected audio as for Instrument Parts.

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Note that the Quantize panel for the Audio Editor is independent from the Music Editor and the Arrangement. This enables you to perfect the rhythmic character of each aspect of the Song and perform those edits quickly without having to adjust the settings each time.

When quantizing an Audio Event, Elastique Pro is used to stretch each region of audio between the Bend Markers.</p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Phase-Coherent Multitrack Quantization</h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When multiple microphones are used to record the same instrument onto multiple Tracks, as with as a drum set, it is very important that the phase relationships across the multitrack audio remain unaltered. You can think of phase relationships as the time it takes sound to reach each microphone from the source, such as a snare drum. How the waveforms align across each Track is critically important to the sound achieved; if a snare hit is moved in time on one Track and not the others, the resulting collective sound of the snare hit can be drastically altered. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Therefore, when quantizing or slicing multitrack audio, it is important that all edits are performed across every Track in a way that preserves the phase relationships. This is referred to as phase-coherent editing. In <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>, all that is required to ensure this happens is for the Tracks to be grouped. Once the Tracks are grouped, <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> takes care of phase coherence for you.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">For instance, let us consider a scenario with four Tracks of drums: kick, snare, and left and right overheads. Prior to editing on any Track individually, you would Group the Tracks by selecting them and pressing [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[G] on the keyboard. If you then quantize audio on any Track in the Group, <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>  determines the phase relationships between the Tracks and then quantizes or slices the audio across all Tracks based on transients on the individual Tracks. For instance, where there is a snare hit, the&#160;first transient found (within the range of the snare hit) in the Tracks from top to bottom is used as the basis for quantization for all four Tracks; the other Tracks  simply maintain their existing phase relationships to the quantized Track, and thus are quantized in a phase-coherent manner. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">In the above scenario, you can check exactly what <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> has done by zooming in on any Bend Marker. You can see that the Bend Marker Range on each Track has been adjusted to a common start time, with the Bend Marker used as the basis for quantization. Manual Bend Marker edits on grouped Tracks  performs the same process. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is also possible to exclude any Tracks in a Group from transient analysis and therefore not use them as a reference in the quantizing or slicing process. When Events are selected that are contained on a Track in a Group, a Group selection box  appears in the Track area of the Bend panel, along with a Guides-selection drop-down menu that contains all Tracks in the Group. To exclude Tracks from analysis, simply uncheck them. As an example, you may only want to use the kick and snare Tracks as the basis for quantization or slicing of the Group, in which case you would uncheck all Tracks except the kick and snare and then apply the desired action from the Bend panel. </p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><a name="kanchor155"></a>Groove Extraction and Quantize</h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Groove Extraction is an extremely powerful, yet simple, feature. Let us consider the scenario in which you want a poorly played bass part to closely follow the kick drum. To make this happen, open the Quantize panel and switch to Groove mode. Next, drag the kick drum Event into the Groove panel, and then quantize the bass Event. In those few moves you have effectively detected all necessary transients, extracted the kick drum groove, and quantized the bass to that groove.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">

                                                </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Similarly, you could drag an Instrument Part into the Groove panel to extract the groove and then quantize audio to that groove. When you extract the groove from an Audio Event or Instrument Part, the grid in the arrangement is then based on that groove, and anything in the arrangement can be quantized to that grid.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">This is extremely useful for cleaning up multi-instrument performances, and it’s equally useful for creative purposes, such as extracting a great groove from a funk loop and applying it to a straight-eighth drum loop. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">You can also drag the groove itself to an Instrument Track, which  renders the groove as a series of notes, one for each hit in the groove, even tweaking note velocity according to the relative level of the hits. This allows you to instantly build a virtual instrument bass part, for instance, that exactly match a drum performance.&#160; Just drag the drum performance into the Groove area, then drag it out to the bass Track, and change the notes to the pattern you want. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Or, you might prefer to drag in an audio Event, drag it to an Instrument Track to tweak the groove musically, then drag that Instrument Part in, and quantize the original audio Event to that. The possibilities are endless!</p>
