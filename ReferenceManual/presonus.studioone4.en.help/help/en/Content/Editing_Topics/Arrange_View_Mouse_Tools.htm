It is helpful to remember that actions done using the mouse tools can be undone at any time, so feel free to explore them. You can click the right mouse button in any open space in the Arrange or Edit views to open a list of mouse tools and editing commands. Choose the desired tool or command by clicking it with the left mouse button. You can also click the middle mouse button (or scroll wheel) to display an expanded list of tools to choose from, including all Paint tool shapes.</p>

                                                <h4 class="Heading4" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Move an Event </h4>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To move an Event using the Arrow tool, click anywhere on the Event and drag left, right, up, or down. Dragging the Event left or right  moves the Event backward and forward in time, relative to the current Timebase and Timeline zoom. When dragging an Event left or right beyond the viewable arrangement, hold [Space Bar] on the keyboard to speed up the scrolling. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Dragging the Event up or down  moves the Event to another existing Track of the same type. If the Event is dragged to a position where no Track currently exists, <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>  creates a new Track of the same type. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When dragging an Event from one Track to another (up or down), the position of the Event is constrained within an automatic snapping range to make it easy to keep the Event at the same time position. To defeat this snapping, hold Shift while dragging the Event up or down. </p>
                                                <h4 class="Heading4" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Size an Event </h4>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Events can be thought of as windows into audio files and musical performances, where what you see is what you hear. Sizing is a fundamental technique wherein Events are made shorter or longer, so that only a portion of the audio or musical data they contain is seen and heard. To size any Event using the Arrow tool, float the mouse to the left or right edge of the Event to reveal the Sizing tool. When this tool appears, click-and-drag left or right to size the Event. Events can be sized and resized nondestructively any number of times. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Two adjacent Events can be sized simultaneously so that no gap is created between them. To do this, float the Arrow tool to the bottom of where the two Events meet in the Timeline, where you can see the sizing icon with both left and right arrows illuminated, and then click-and-drag left or right. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Holding [Alt]/[Option] on the keyboard and then sizing an Event from the right edge  results in the Event being freely timestretched. Refer to the <a href="Timestretching.htm">Timestretching</a> section of this chapter for more information.</p>
                                                <h4 class="Heading4" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><a name="kanchor113"></a>Adjust Audio Event Volume Envelopes </h4>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">All Audio Events feature a basic volume envelope that allows the volume of the audio to be shaped in several ways. Using the volume envelope, you can create a fade-in and fade-out, as well as set a constant volume level between the fades. The volume envelope applies gain changes to the audio clip in the Event and is therefore at the front end of the audio signal path. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To create a fade-in or fade-out, click-and-drag left or right on the Fade Flag in the upper left or right corner of an Audio Event. By default, a linear fade is created over the length you have moved the Fade Flag. Fade times, as well as Event gain, can also be edited in the Inspector for any selected Event.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To change the curve of the fade, click on the Fade Curve box in the middle of the fade curve and drag up or down. The fade curve  determines how quickly or slowly the fade occurs and changes over time. If you press and hold [Shift] while editing the fade length or the curve, you can edit both at once. Dragging up or down edits the curve, and dragging left or right changes the length. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is also possible to drag a complete crossfade left or right, or up or down, in order to change the location and characteristics of the fade. Float the mouse to the center of the crossfade until the Hand icon appears, then click and drag to adjust. Dragging left or right  adjusts the location of the fade, extending or shortening the crossfaded Events. Dragging up or down  alters the shape of the crossfade.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To adjust the overall volume level of an Audio Event, click on the volume box in the center of the volume envelope and drag up or down. As you adjust the volume envelope, the audio waveform is redrawn to approximate the effect of the adjustment. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Range tool is used to select a range, or area, within Events. Click on the Range tool button or press [number 2] on the keyboard to select the Range tool. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To select a range within an Event, using the Range tool, click-and-drag over the area to be selected; a gray box is drawn over the target selection area. Release the mouse button when the box is drawn over the range of the Events you wish to select. The range you have selected is now treated as a single, consolidated Event. Clicking once with the Range tool on a Track moves the play cursor to that location.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">For instance, you can use the Range tool to select the content of several Audio Events across multiple Tracks in bar 12, and then use the Arrow tool to move that section of audio to bar 14. Another common use of the Range tool is to quickly select and delete a range of audio within an Event, rather than using the Split tool to make two splits, then select and delete the section with the Arrow tool. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When you float the mouse cursor over a selected range, the Arrow tool  temporarily appears. This makes it easy to quickly select and edit a range of Events. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To select multiple, non-contiguous ranges across any Event, on any Track, hold the [Shift] key while using the Range tool. Continue to hold [Shift] and use the Arrow tool to select whole Events. For instance, when using the Arrow tool, if you press and hold [Ctrl], you get the Range tool. Press and hold [Ctrl] and [Shift] to select multiple ranges, then continue to hold [Shift] but release [Ctrl]; now you have the Arrow tool and can select whole Events. All of your selections  remain selected. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To split an event in half without reaching for the Split tool, double-click at your chosen split point. Double-click a selected range to split the Events in that range at the left and right borders of the range.</p>

By splitting a single Event, you create two Events that can be edited independently. If multiple Events are selected across multiple Tracks, the Split tool  affects all of the selected Events in the same way. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is also possible to split selected Events at the timeline cursor, without using the Split tool, by pressing [Alt]+[X] on the keyboard.

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Normally, if you split an Instrument Part at a point that falls within one or more notes, those notes are truncated at the split point, and no longer play in the newly created Part to the right of the split point. This can be an issue, especially when splitting up Parts in which some notes are held for long periods, such as pad and string passages. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">For example, if you have a four-bar Part in which a chord is played and held throughout, splitting the Part in the middle leaves the Part to the left of the split point mostly untouched. However, the held notes are now missing from the newly created Part to the right of the split point.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To split an Instrument Part and split&#160;(rather than truncate) any notes that cross the split point, hold [Alt]/[Opt] while you make the split. </p>
