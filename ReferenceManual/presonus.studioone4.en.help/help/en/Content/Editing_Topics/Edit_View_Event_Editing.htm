                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">In many cases, editing actions  require a close look at the Events being edited. To perform these edits in the Arrange view would require zooming in to a level that would make it difficult to retain your sense of the overall Song structure, then zooming back out after the edits are performed. Edit views allow you to avoid this inefficiency. To open the Edit view for the selected Event, click on the [Edit] button, press [F2] on the keyboard, or double-click on any Event. You can also open the Editor by selecting Editor from the View menu. While there is a common Edit view, Audio Events open in the Audio Editor, and Instrument Parts open in the Music Editor. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Edit view  displays the currently selected Event on a timeline that is independent of the Arrange view timeline. By default, the Edit view timeline is zoomed in further than the default Arrange view timeline. While the Edit view is open, double-clicking an Event in Arrange view  zooms the Edit view to contain the full Event.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Editor can be detached to its own sizable window by clicking on the Detach button at the upper right of the Editor. Any Track can be selected from the Track drop-down selector to the upper left of the Editor, under the toolbar.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The [Action] button (available in both the Audio and Music Editors) gives you quick access to functions you might normally access by [Right]/[Ctrl]-clicking on an Event and exploring the Audio or Musical Functions sub-menus.</p>
                                                <h3 class="Heading3" data-mc-conditions="General.Online"><a name="kanchor167"></a>Audio Editor </h3>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Audio Editor display operates independently of the Arrange view and has an independent Timebase setting. Most options that appear in the Editor are the same as in the <a href="Arrange_View_Mouse_Tools.htm">Arrange</a> view and  affect tools and Events in the same way. Note that the Snap and Timebase settings are not shared between the Arrange view and Editor; they remain independent. A Snap to Event Hotspots option is found in the Editor Snap dropdown menu; it allows tool and Event snapping to hotspots such as Bend Markers. The dropdown menu also includes a Snap to Zero Crossings option, which will help avoid an unnatural click at the beginning of the audio data when the Event is moved or split..</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The displayed level scale to the left of the waveform lane in the Audio Editor can be adjusted by clicking on it and dragging left or right. This effectively zooms the waveform amplitude, which may be useful when editing audio with relatively low levels. [Right]/[Ctrl]-clicking in this area allows the selection of a percentage- or dB-based scale. You can also adjust this zoom level by manipulating the Data Zoom parameter, found to the right of the Time Zoom slider control.</p>
                                                <h4 class="Heading4" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Tools </h4>

(Only the Paint tool is not available in the Audio Editor.)</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Instrument Parts contain notes, which represent musical performance data and are a type of Event. Notes can be moved, cut, copied, pasted, duplicated, and drawn using mouse tools, key commands, and certain Event menu commands. Multiple notes can be selected and edited together, as with other Events. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">For quick editing of all notes in a Part or on the Track, use [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[A] to select all of the notes in the focused Part in the Music Editor, or [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[Shift]+[A] to select all notes in all Parts on the Track. You can also access the full set of selection actions by navigating to the Select section of the Edit menu.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">You can zoom in or out horizontally in the Music Editor by moving the Time Zoom control, and zoom vertically with the Data Zoom control.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Music Editor has independent settings similar to those in the Audio Editor. While Quantize affects the horizontal time-value snapping, the Music Editor also features Scale (vertical note-value) snapping. The Scale settings allow snapping to specific note values within different musical scales. Enable the Scale function by clicking its toggle switch, then select a scale by choosing the starting note and the musical scale in the respective selectors. The notes contained in the selected scale are marked on the Music Editor's keyboard display, as well as in the single-octave keyboard display above the Scale selector. </p>
                                                <h4 class="Heading4" data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Arrow Tool </h4>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The Arrow tool in the Music Editor is used with notes in essentially the same way as the Arrow tool in the Arrange view is used with Events. Multiple notes can be selected and edited together in the same way as <a href="Events.htm">Events</a>.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To move a note using the Arrow tool, click anywhere on the note and drag left, right, up, or down. Dragging the note left or right  moves it backward and forward in time, relative to the current Edit view timebase and timeline zoom. Dragging the note up or down  transposes (change the pitch of) the note. The transposition interval can be determined by using the vertical keyboard display to the left of the Music Editor. </p>
                                                <h5 data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Creating Notes</h5>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To create a note using the Arrow tool, double-click in any empty space in the Edit view. A note is created at the location you've specified, its length determined by the currently selected Quantize value. Double-click a note with the Arrow tool to delete it.</p>

When this tool appears, click-and-drag left or right to size the note. As with Events, notes can be sized and resized any number of times. A Part can also be sized in this way, by floating the cursor near the top of the Part's beginning or end, revealing the Sizing tool.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To change the length of a note while simultaneously resizing the previous or following note to match, hover your cursor near the beginning or end of a note, press and hold [Alt]/[Option] to enable Resize Adjacent Notes mode, and click and drag the note to resize.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When sizing multiple selected notes in the Music Editor with the Arrow tool, three additional behaviors are possible using modifier keys. Select multiple notes, then click on the end of one note and drag it to the right just a small amount.

Each of these parameters can be edited directly in the Inspector. When editing notes using the Inspector, all selected notes are affected, their values changing relative to the initial setting of each note. The one exception is that when Velocity is specified for multiple notes using the Inspector, all notes snap to the new value, regardless of their previous Velocity value.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The simplest way to edit start and end positions, pitch, and velocity is to place the mouse cursor over the parameter and scroll the mouse wheel up or down. Another way to edit a selected note’s velocity is to click-and-drag the Velocity value in the Music Editor's Inspector pane. When you release the mouse button, the Velocity value is applied to all selected notes. The value currently set by the Velocity parameter is applied by default to any new notes created with the Paint Tool.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Enable the Audition Notes option to hear the pitch of each note that is selected, created, or moved, played through the current instrument.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">You can also Mute, Solo, or open the Device Editor for the current Track from within the Music Editor Inspector, using buttons that look much like their counterparts in the Arrange view.</p>

In this Track List, you can show or hide Tracks via the Show/Hide button to the left of the Track name and can independently set each Track to Edit Active via the pencil-shaped Edit button to the far right of the Track name. If a Track is shown, and Edit Active is not engaged, the Track’s notes are not selectable, allowing it to be easily viewed as a reference without concern about altering it accidentally. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When multiple Parts are displayed, the notes for each Part are colored with their Track colors and audition normally through their Tracks. Selected notes are displayed in red. Also, when multiple parts are displayed it is possible to transfer notes from one part to another using the [Right]/[Ctrl]-click contextual menu item Transfer Notes. This  removes the selected notes from the original Part, indicated with a checkmark in the Transfer Notes list, to the selected Part. </p>

Drum programming and editing present a different challenge. Percussive sounds often contain their own amplitude envelope that ends at a pre-determined time,  which makes the start of each note the most important part. For added clarity when working on this sort of content, <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span> features a dedicated Drum Editor view that shows your drum notes as "triggers," marking the start of each note.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To view the Drum Editor, click the drum-shaped button at the top of the Music Editor pane. You can return to the standard view at any time by clicking the keyboard-shaped button. While in the Drum Editor view, you can add, remove, and manipulate notes just as you normally can, with some useful differences.</p>

When you view an Impact XT part in the Drum Editor, instead of seeing the full range of notes, you see each currently loaded sound as a row in the grid. with its name and color code visible, for easy programming and editing. Any unused notes are hidden.</p>

In the Drum Editor, since note length is not shown, you can click and drag across the grid, entering multiple new notes at divisions set by the current Quantize value. This makes creating drum patterns, fills, and rolls a more fluid process.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online"> Drum maps can be downloaded for many commercially available instruments and libraries from <a href="http://exchange.presonus.com/">http://exchange.presonus.com</a>.
