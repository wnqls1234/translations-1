The Events are pasted on the selected Track, at the current playback cursor position. If you select and copy Events on multiple Tracks, then select another timeline location on the first Track, and then paste, the copied Events are pasted in the appropriate Tracks and locations, starting with the first (selected) Track. </li>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Often, after an Audio Event has been sized to fit a particular region of time, the audio clip the Event contains needs to be moved ahead or behind in time without changing the Event’s length and volume envelope. This action is commonly called “slipping” or “slip,” and it is often used alongside splitting, or splicing, to correct the timing of rhythm tracks. For instance, if one snare-drum hit is off the beat by a little bit, you could split the Event on either side of that section and then slip the audio into perfect time. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To use Slip, select the Arrow tool, and then press and hold [Ctrl]/[Cmd]+[Alt] on the keyboard, while floating the mouse over an Audio Event. The Slip tool icon  appears. Click-and-drag on the Event to slip the audio left or right across the timeline. Multiple Audio Events can be selected and slipped at once, even across multiple Tracks. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When slipping the audio in an Audio Event, note that all of the Event characteristics remain unchanged, including the Event size, position, Inspector parameters, and volume envelope. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">An Audio Event can be slipped only as far as the length of the audio clip it contains. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The ability to transpose and fine-tune audio adds a lot of flexibility when working with audio files. For instance, if you have a keyboard loop collection in which every loop is in the key of C, being able to transpose these loops to any other key opens up many possibilities. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">In <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>, transposing and tuning are a part of the same set of advanced algorithms as timestretching, so the quality is extremely high. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">To transpose any audio Event, select it and open the Inspector by pressing [F4] on the keyboard or clicking on the Inspector button above the Track Column. Then enter a value in the Transpose field, from -24 to +24 semitones.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Any number of Events can be selected and transposed or tuned simultaneously, but note that this change is not relative to the current setting of each Event. All selected Events are transposed or tuned to the same chosen value.</p>

The duplicated Event is always placed after the original Event, and it is automatically selected once duplicated. As with the other editing actions, Duplicate can apply to any number of currently selected Events. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">A good use of the Duplicate command is to quickly create copies of a loop across a region in a Song by selecting an Event and repeatedly pressing [D] on the keyboard. Another interesting use involves selecting very short regions within a loop, using the Range tool, and duplicating them several times, consecutively, in order to create a stutter effect that is popular in electronic music. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If you would like to duplicate an Event and push existing material to the right across the timeline to make room for the duplicated Event, press [Alt]+[D] on the keyboard to use the Duplicate and Insert command. </p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When you duplicate an Event normally, each duplicate is treated as a separate Event, and edits made to one duplicate are not reflected in the other copies. If you want to duplicate an Instrument Part and link the content of the duplicates to that of the original Part, select the Part and choose Duplicate Shared from the Edit menu, or press [Shift] +&#160;[D] on the keyboard. A ghost icon appears on the original Part and any Shared duplicates, to alert you that those copies are now Shared. Any edits made to the original Part or a Shared copy are applied to all instances of that Part.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">If you later decide you wish to edit one of the Shared copies of a Part individually, select it and choose Separate Shared Copies from the Event menu. The ghost icon disappears from that Part to alert you that the copy is no longer Shared, and can be edited without affecting the other copies.</p>

                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">It is sometimes helpful to explode existing pitches within an Instrument Part to new Tracks, placing each pitch within individual Instrument Parts on separate Tracks. For instance, if you have a MIDI loop to use with a virtual drum instrument, you may want to have each piece of the drum kit on its own Instrument Track. </p>

It may be helpful in these cases to remove the gaps and only keep the desired sections of the recorded Event. <span class="GeneralProductName">Studio One</span>'s Strip Silence function, controlled from the Strip Silence panel, is designed to handle this task.</p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">Open the Strip Silence panel by clicking on the Strip Silence button in the toolbar, or select Strip Silence from the<span class="Italic"> View/Additional Views</span> menu.

Click on the [Default] button to return all settings in the panel to their defaults. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">The result of the Strip Silence process is similar to using a gate processor to only allow the desired signal to be heard, except that the Event is edited. </p>
                                                <p data-mc-conditions="General.Online">When the small light indicator next to the [Apply] button is lit, this means that changing the Detection or Event options and then clicking Apply  automatically undos the previous operation, making it easier to find the right settings by viewing the result of the Strip Silence process, then tweaking the settings if needed without having to undo manually. Any change in selection (or other editing operation)  ends this automatic state, and the indicator is no longer lit.&#160; </p>
